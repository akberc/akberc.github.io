[![](/assets/2010/opensocial.jpg)](/assets/2010/opensocial.jpg)While businesses are busy making the move to socially-connected and interactive online experience for their customers and partners, some common issues are starting to emerge, for example:
-- Do we have the critical mass to set up our own social network, or do we piggy-back on to an existing network?
-- Do we put all our eggs in the Facebook basket?
-- Does the choice of external social network show something about our brand and our market positioning?
-- Do we need to keep adding and tweaking our APIs for the various social networks out there?

This is a situation crying out for standardisation, and [OpenSocial](http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/)appears to have the momentum behind it right now.Â  With v1.0 released earlier this year, many of the big players are on board, and Liferay reportedly delayed the release of version 6 of its portal in order to position OpenSocial front and centre in the new version.
