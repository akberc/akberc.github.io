OK, let us go back in time.  Before the commercial Internet, I saved some money and bought Turbo Pascal from a store on King's Highway, Brooklyn, New York.

I was learning to touch type in those days, so I wrote a program to help me to touch type.  With some polish, I compiled and put it on a floppy and shipped it to a shareware publisher who used to send out shareware floppy disks every month.

Software and review/intro attached.  Here is the opening screen:
