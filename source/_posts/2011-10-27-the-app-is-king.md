Networks, storage, and all other information technology infrastructure are fairly complicated things and it takes substantial planning and flawless execution to get it right.

Project managers and analysts do great work to ensure that what runs on these infrastructure systems is properly specified and delivered on time.

And with all this hard work, and whether data is delivered over 4G mobile or 10G ethernet, all that users see is the App.  Nothing matters if the app is not there when the user wants it, and how the user wants it.

The App is King.
