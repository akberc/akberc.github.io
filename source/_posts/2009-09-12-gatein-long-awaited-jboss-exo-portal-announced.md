At the RedHat Summit in Chicago, RedHat announced the next version of JBoss Portal (3.0), named [GateIn](http://www.jboss.org/gatein). The stated goal is to replace the rather stale look and feel of JBoss Portal 2.7.x with the eXo platform capabilities, while keeping the robust JBoss infrastructure.

After playing around a bit with the beta version, the UI seems very fresh, but page rendering is slow and AJAX use is quite limited. Also, content management was a bit confusing. Looking forward to testing the GA version.
