Last year, there was an opportunity to participate in IBM's Cloud Beta and I [wrote about]({{site.url}}/ibms-test-and-dev-cloud/) some initial impressions.

IBM have now rolled this out with geographically dispersed data centres.  Even with some terms being unique to IBM, the provisioning of instances and management of images should be familiar to those who have worked with Amazon's EC2 and related cloud services.

This gives 'true Blue' customers an option to entrust sensitive systems to a cloud provider with whom there is an existing relationship.  It will be interesting to see how this offering from IBM stacks up against managed services from IBM.
